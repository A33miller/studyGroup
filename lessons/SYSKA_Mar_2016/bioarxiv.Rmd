## Current publishing system.

Scientific manuscripts are peer-reviewed to assess quality

***Disadvantages:***

    - Speed
    - Access - the dreaded "paywall"
    - Nonsense still gets through all the time.
    - University buy back their own articles.
  
***Benefits:***
  
    - Filters the scientific literature
    - Hiring criteria
    - Assesses the impact of the work.


## Pre-prints

Facilitates circulation of scientific knowledge early, and for free before the peer-review
process begins.

Since 1991, Math, Physics, and other quantative discplines they have had and used  a pre-print server known as the arXiv.

http://arxiv.org/


## Why Pre-prints?

Simply when a draft of a manuscript is complete it is uploaded to an open access webserver.

***Percieved Disadvantages:***

    - Scooping.
    - Might prevent publication.
    - Filtering bad papers.
  
***Benefits:***
  
    - Access to the newest ideas months in advance.
    - Open Access.
    - Priority.

Only a few years old, but showing promise.


### My apple paper is on there:
http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/07/15/021857

  - Paper was published in BMC genomics in august, was on BioarXiv in July.

  - 248 PDF downloads.
    
## But why are biologists talking about it now?

Recent publication argues that pre-prints are the way forward for biology.

  - Pre-print: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/07/11/022368.full.pdf+html
  - Publication: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/44/13439.abstract

## It even lead to a conference.

Here is a storify with tweets from Michael Eisen of UCBerkeley, and Jessica Polka a PostDoc at Harvard.

Basically, they called for the most famous scientists and the funders with the least to lose to embrace this new mode of 
publishing. Recognizing that vunerable early career research could be damaged if they adopt this.

## A transitional hybrid model, then PPPR

Post-publication peer-review (PPPR) is an evolution from the pre-print to journal review and publication pipeline. 

###  Publication timeline
  - Do science!
  - Write science!
  - Publish science! No review necessary.
  - Reviews happen post-publication.
  
Journals, such as http://f1000research.com/ are already doing this.

See http://f1000research.com/articles/4-121/v1 for an prominent example of how it can work.

## Use pre-prints!!!!
